# Introduction

The project focuses on comparing three different neural networks in order to classify ECG datasets into abnormal or normal heart-rates. The selected Neural Networks to use were: Inception, LSTM and ResNet-50.

Questions which will be answered.

1. Which neural networks produce the highest classification metrics when classifying the ECG data?

2. Can the most accurate neural network be considered the most reasonable to use?
